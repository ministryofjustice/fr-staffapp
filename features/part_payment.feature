Feature: Processing part payments

  Background: Processed refund application that requires a part payment
    Given I successfully sign in as a user
    And I have processed an application that is a part payment

  Scenario: Successfully ppart_payment_stepsrocess part payment
    And the payment is ready to process
    When I complete processing
    And I open the processed part payment application
    Then I can see that the applicant has paid Â£40 towards the fee

  Scenario: Part payment is not ready to process
    When the payment is not ready to process
    Then I should see my reason on the part payments summary page
    And I can see that the applicant needs to make a new application
    When processing is complete I should see a letter template
