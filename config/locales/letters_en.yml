        <p>Maximum amount of savings and investments allowed: %{savings_threshold}</p>
        <p>Your savings and investments total: %{savings_total}</p>
        <p><strong>If you disagree with this decision</strong></p>
        <p>If you disagree with our decision, you can appeal to the Delivery Manager at the court or tribunal dealing with your fee.</p>

        <p><strong>Reference: %{reference}</strong></p>
        <p>We have received your application for help with fees. Unfortunately you’re not eligible and will have to pay the full fee. This is because the Department for Work and Pensions did not confirm that you’re receiving one of these benefits:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA)</li>

          <li>Pension Credit (guarantee credit)</li>
          <li>Scottish Civil Legal Aid</li>

        <p><strong>If this result is unexpected</strong></p>
        <p>If you disagree with our decision, you can appeal to the Delivery Manager at the court or tribunal dealing with your fee.</p>
        <p>If you’ve started receiving benefits in the last 7 days: the Department for Work and Pensions may not have up to date information for you.
        If this is the case, return your application along with an official letter that confirms the benefits received.</p>
        <p>If you receive benefits with your partner: return your application with a letter from the Department for Work and Pensions confirming the benefit received.
        If the benefit is in your partner’s name, you should include a letter confirming your address is the same as your partner’s.</p>
        <p>You must write your reference number<strong> %{reference}</strong> on any letters that you send.</p>
        <p>Check the name of the benefit: there are some benefits that are similarly named to the 6 qualifying benefits:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>contribution-based Job Seekers Allowance</li>
